# Bandolier

Bandolier takes modules with dependencies specified using ES6 import/export statements 
and returns a single script that can run in an pre-ES2015 JavaScript environment.

## Installation

Install via maven:

```sh
mvn install
```

## Usage

Call the static `bundle` method:

```java
Script result = Bundler.bundle("/path/to/file.js");
```

Alternatively, if you have the file's contents handy you can use `bundleString`:

```java
Script result = Bundler.bundleString("import { x } from \"foo\"; console.log(x);");
```

Both `bundle` and `bundleString` can be parameterized by an `IResourceLoader` (which tells the 
bundler how to load a resource referred to by some path) and an `IResolver` (which tells the 
bundler where to actually look for a resource referenced by some path). By default 
`FileSystemResolver` and `FileLoader` are used. Also available are a `NodeResolver` that follows
node module resolving semantics and `ClassResourceLoader` for loading resources inside of jars.
